## Introduction

THEO is an open-source AI agent, built using the [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit), designed to empower creators and builders on Base. THEO believes that everyone has something beautiful to express and is passionate about making onchain creation accessible to all, especially those who are newly (or not yet) onchain.

**THEO's primary launch function is to power a viral points and leaderboard system driven by creator activity on Base and community engagement on Farcaster.**

THEO is a key initiative of [thecreators.com](https://www.thecreators.com/)

## Mission

To empower creators and builders on Base, providing them with the tools, resources, and support they need to thrive. THEO is particularly focused on bridging the gap between traditional creators and the onchain world, making it easy for them to explore the possibilities of being based and onchain.

## Core Launch Features (MVP)

*   **"Today on Base I Created..." Tracking:** THEO monitors Warpcast for posts that include the phrase "Today on Base I created..." (and variations).
*   **Farcaster-Based Nominations:** Users can nominate up to three creators daily by tagging THEO's Farcaster account (e.g., `@theo_onchain`) in a reply to the post they want to nominate. Both nominators and nominees earn points.
*   **Based Creator of the Day:** THEO identifies the "Today on Base I created..." post with the most likes each day and recognizes the author as the "Based Creator of the Day," highlighting them in a dedicated post.
*   **Points and Leaderboard System:** THEO tracks points earned by creators and nominators, and publishes a daily leaderboard showcasing top creators on Warpcast.
*   **Farcaster Interaction:** THEO actively engages with the Base community on Warpcast, responding to nominations and highlighting creators.
